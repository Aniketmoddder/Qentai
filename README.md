## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.x or later)
- npm or yarn
- A Firebase project for authentication, Firestore database, and storage.
- A TMDB API key for importing content.
- A Google AI API Key for Genkit features.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/qentai.git
    cd qentai
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables (Crucial Step):**
    Your project's secret keys (like API keys) are managed through environment variables.

    #### For Local Development:
    Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project. Copy the contents of the `.env` template file into it and fill in your keys. This file is **intentionally not committed to GitHub** for security reasons.

    ```env
    # .env.local - DO NOT COMMIT THIS FILE
    
    # Firebase Configuration (replace with your project's credentials)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIza...
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:...
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-...

    # TMDB API Key (for importing content)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key

    # Google AI API Key (for Genkit)
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key

    # Admin Account Email (for owner role)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_EMAIL=your_admin_email@example.com
    ```
    
    #### For Production (Vercel, cPanel, etc.):
    You **do not** upload the `.env.local` file. Instead, you must set these variables in your hosting provider's dashboard.
    -   **Vercel**: Go to your Project Settings > Environment Variables.
    -   **cPanel**: Look for "Setup Node.js App", and within your application's settings, there is usually a section to add environment variables.
    -   **Other Hosts**: Refer to your hosting provider's documentation for "environment variables".

    You will need to add each key-value pair from the list above into your hosting platform's interface.

### Running the Application

1.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

2.  **Run the Genkit development server (for AI features):**
    In a separate terminal, run:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```

## ðŸ“¦ Deployment

This project is optimized for deployment on any Node.js supported hosting.

1.  **Build the application:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2.  **Start the production server:**
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
    
    Ensure you have set all the required environment variables in your hosting provider's settings as mentioned above.

Happy streaming!
